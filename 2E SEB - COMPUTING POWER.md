## SEB - MEAN VALUE

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the mean of a given number using an appropriate built-in function.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Read three integer inputs from the user and store them in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. Define a function `result(a, b, c)` to calculate the mean as `(a + b + c) / 3` and print it.
4. Call the function `result(a, b, c)` and **terminate the program**.

### PROGRAM
```
Reg.No: 212223060266
Nmae: Snega G

def result(a, b, c):
    mean=(a+b+c) / 3
    print(f"mean is {mean}")
    
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
```
