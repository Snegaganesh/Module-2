## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - RELATING TWO NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in `a` and `b`.
3. Define a lambda function `r` that compares `a` and `b` and returns a formatted string indicating the greater number.
4. Call the lambda function with `a` and `b` and display the result using `print()`.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
Reg.No: 212223060266
Nme: Snega G

r=lambda a,b: f"The greatest number is: {a}" if a>b else f"The greatest number is: {b}"
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(r(a,b))
```

### RESULT
Thus a a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function was executed successfully.
